    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOP? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It provides a way to represent real-world objects in a simplified manner. Abstraction allows you to create a model that omits the unnecessary details and emphasizes the relevant characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's consider the concept of a \"Vehicle.\" In real life, a vehicle can be a car, a bike, a bus, etc. We can abstract the common features of these vehicles, such as the ability to move, the number of wheels, and the fuel used. By abstracting these common attributes and behaviors, we can create a general \"Vehicle\" class that can be inherited by specific vehicle types like \"Car,\" \"Bike,\" and \"Bus.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, wheels, fuel):\n",
    "        self.wheels = wheels\n",
    "        self.fuel = fuel\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        pass  # Placeholder for movement logic\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, fuel):\n",
    "        super().__init__(4, fuel)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        return \"Car is moving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bike(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, fuel):\n",
    "        super().__init__(2, fuel)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bike is moving\"\n",
    "In this example, the abstracted concept of a \"Vehicle\" is defined with common attributes and a placeholder method for movement. Concrete classes like \"Car\" and \"Bike\" inherit from the abstract class and provide their own implementations of the \"move\" method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is about representing the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It focuses on creating a simplified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts direct access to the internal details of an object and provides controlled access through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's extend the \"Vehicle\" example from above to illustrate both concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, wheels, fuel):\n",
    "        self.wheels = wheels\n",
    "        self.fuel = fuel\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        pass  # Placeholder for movement logic\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, fuel):\n",
    "        super().__init__(4, fuel)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        return \"Car is moving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bike(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, fuel):\n",
    "        super().__init__(2, fuel)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bike is moving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car(\"Gasoline\")\n",
    "print(car.move())  # Output: Car is moving\n",
    "print(car.wheels)  # Accessing attribute directly - Encapsulation violation\n",
    "\n",
    "bike = Bike(\"Petrol\")\n",
    "print(bike.move())  # Output: Bike is moving\n",
    "print(bike.wheels)  # Accessing attribute directly - Encapsulation violation\n",
    "In this example, abstraction is achieved by creating the \"Vehicle\" class to represent the common attributes and behaviors of vehicles. Encapsulation is achieved by encapsulating the attributes (wheels and fuel) within the class and providing controlled access through methods. However, in the example, there's a violation of encapsulation when directly accessing the wheels attribute, which ideally should be accessed through methods like getters and setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the abc module in Python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides mechanisms to define abstract classes and enforce the implementation of specific methods in subclasses. Abstract base classes are classes that are not meant to be instantiated directly but serve as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to create and work with abstract classes and ensure that certain methods are implemented in the derived classes. Abstract classes can define abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be overridden in concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction can be achieved by creating abstract classes that provide a blueprint for derived classes while hiding the implementation details. Here are the steps to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an Abstract Class: Define an abstract class that contains attributes and methods which represent the common properties and behaviors you want to abstract.\n",
    "Define Abstract Methods: In the abstract class, define abstract methods that do not have an implementation. These methods serve as placeholders that must be overridden in concrete subclasses.\n",
    "Inherit and Implement: Create concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class. In these subclasses, provide implementations for the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.\n",
    "Use Abstraction: Instantiate and use the concrete subclasses to create objects with the desired attributes and behaviors. Users of the subclasses interact with the abstracted interface rather than the underlying details.\n",
    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. Abstract classes are meant to be blueprints for other classes to inherit from. They are incomplete classes that define the structure and behavior that subclasses should implement. Since abstract classes contain abstract methods without implementations, creating an instance of an abstract class would be meaningless and may result in errors due to the missing implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create objects, you need to instantiate concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class. These subclasses provide implementations for the abstract methods and can be instantiated to create usable objects."
